# Classy Plugin

To implement a plugin, ensure that this directory is substituted with a valid plugin.

Read (Application Customization)[https://github.com/ubccpsctech/classy/blob/feature/default-customization/docs/developer/customization.md#application-customization] to create valid plugin. 

If this directory is not overwritten, Clasy's default behaviour will be impelmented.
