# CPSC340 Backend

* `Assignments` - A deliverable that will be hand marked

## AssignmentController
This contains the methods to control assignments, and 
any methods that interact with assignments (processing them, etc).

* Assignments are only created for students who have been added to the class
(by csv), **and** are still part of the Github org.
