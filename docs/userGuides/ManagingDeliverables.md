## Manually provisioning, releasing or closing repositories
- Log onto Classy (e.g. https://mds.cs.ubc.ca)
- Navigate to the `Config` tab, using the top navigation bar.
- Click `Manage Repositories`
- Select the deliverable from the dropdown
- Select the operation you wish to do, using the buttons
  - `Provision All Repositories`: Create all repositories for the given deliverable (this does _not_ release the repositories to the students)
  - `Create and Release All Repositories`: Release all repositories for the given deliverable, creating the repositories as needed (this will give students `write` access)
  - `Close Repositories`: Removes `write` access from all student repositories (still keeps `read` access), then parses the main file (if applicable) for the Assignment Rubric
